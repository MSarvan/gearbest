# GEARBEST CLONE
As a member from the FT-Web12, I am on the verge of completion of the fourth unit and it was during the final week which is depicted as the construct week in Masai Bootcamp where the students were assigned to build the clone of any major website and the one allotted for me was “gearbest.com”.
